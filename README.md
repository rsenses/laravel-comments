This package provides an incredibly simple comment system for your Laravel applications.

> If you're looking for a package with UI components, I highly recommend using [Spatie's `laravel-comments`](https://laravel-comments.com/) package which comes with Livewire support out of the box.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require rsenses/laravel-comments
```

The package automatically registers migrations so there's no need to publish anything, just run them.

```
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="comments-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [

    'model' => \Rsenses\Comments\Models\Comment::class,

    'user' => \App\Models\User::class,

];
```

## Usage

Start by using the `Rsenses\Comments\Concerns\HasComments` trait on your model.

```php
use Rsenses\Comments\Concerns\HasComments;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasComments;
}
```

This trait adds a `comments(): MorphMany` relationship on your model. It also adds a new `comment()` method that can be used to quickly add a comment to your model.

```php
$post = Post::first();

$post->comment('Hello, world!');
```

By default, the package will use the authenticated user's ID as the "commentor". You can customise this by providing a custom `User` to the `comment()` method.

```php
$post->comment('Hello, world!', user: User::first());
```

The package also supports `parent -> children` relationships for comments. This means that a comment can `belongTo` another comment.

```php
$post->comment('Thanks for commenting!', parent: Comment::find(2));
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
